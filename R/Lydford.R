#' Lydford Primary School's bat walk observations
#'
#' These are Lydford Primary School's bat walk observations from Wednesday
#' evening 18^th^ September 2019.  The walk, between the School and the River Lyd,
#' on the western edge of Dartmoor, started at sunset 6:27pm and continued for
#' just over an hour.  The observations were made with a Batlogger M bat detector
#' (https://www.batlogger.com/en/products/batlogger_m/) that records the sound
#' of the bat as it passes together with the time and postion; using a built-in
#' Global Positioning System (GPS).  These sounds where then analysed with software
#' designed to help determine which species made the echolocation;
#' https://www.batlogger.com/en/products/batexplorer/) was the software used.
